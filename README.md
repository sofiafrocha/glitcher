# Glitcher (WIP)

You'll (eventually) give a picture, and get a (glitched) picture.   
This is just a way to test out [P5.js](http://p5js.org/) and experiment with Pixel Sorting ([again](https://github.com/sofiafrocha/PixelSortUm)).

## To try it out
1. Run `npm install`
2. Open the `index.html` file
